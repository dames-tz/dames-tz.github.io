## INDICATOR QUESTIONS & INTERPRETATION
1. **QUESTION** : How many newly enrolled AGYW (number and proportion) were referred from health care facilities? 
    - **Presentation** : Bar chart
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**: 
        - This graph shows the proportion of newly enrolled DREAMS beneficiaries who were referred from health facilities to the DREAMS program. Those girls not referred from a health facility are recruited in a variety of ways / referred from a number of different institutions, such as local government authorities.
2. **QUESTION** : Enrollment and retention cascade Enrolled, active, completed at least primary package
    - **Presentation** : Bar chart
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**: 
        - The enrollment and retention cascade shows the retention of girls in the DREAMS program, from enrollment to completion of at least primary package in the reporting year. Each bar in the cascade is a subset of the previous bar. Analysis in this cascade is restricted to girls who were enrolled in the selected reporting year.
        - **Active is defined as**: AGYW who is enrolled in DREAMS and has started or completed at least one DREAMS service/intervention in the reporting period Completion of the primary package is defined as: Primary package Completion requires that an individual AGYW has fully completed all services/interventions listed under primary package.
3. **QUESTION** : What is the loss to follow-up or default rate by SNU/site?
    - **Presentation** : Stacked bar
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This chart shows the proportion of girls who actively participated in the DREAMS program in previous reporting years but were lost (i.e., became inactive) before completing the program. _This rate is calculated by dividing the number of girls who were enrolled and became active in DREAM in year X  but have become inactive in the current year without having completed the program and  divided by total number of enrolled girls in that year_.
        - **LTFU is defined as**: AGYW who is enrolled in DREAMS is termed as Lost to Follow-up (Inactive) when at one time had started or completed at least one DREAMS service/intervention but has not started or completed a service/intervention within the past 6 months.
4. **QUESTION** : What is the return rate among those LTFU?
    - **Presentation** : Pie chart 
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This chart shows the proportion of girls who were lost to follow-up in any previous reporting year but have been re-engaged in DREAMS in the current reporting year. The return rate is calculated by dividing the number of re-engaged girls by the total number of girls previously designated as LTFU.
5. **QUESTION** : How many unique clients is DREAMS serving, does this align with program targets?
    - **Presentation** : Bar chart 
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This visual shows progress towards the annual target for the number of DREAMS beneficiaries who have completed at least the primary package (AGYW_PREV) in the selected reporting year. 
6. **QUESTION** : BY SNU & age-group, what is the proportion of DREAMS AGYW in each of the 4 AGYW_PREV disaggs?
    - **Presentation** : Stacked chart horintal bars
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This indicator reflects the status and trends of DREAMS package completion as measured through the number of active girls in the 4 AGYW_PREV disaggregates. The values represent the number of girls who are in each disaggregate at the time of the latest data update (synchronization).
7. **QUESTION** : What proportion of DREAMS AGYW have completed at least the primary package?
    - **Presentation** : Bar chart
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This cascade shows the number of active girls in the selected year (regardless of the year they were enrolled in the program) and their pathways toward DREAMS completion. Each bar in the cascade is a subset of the previous one.
        - _Active as defined_: AGYWS who have been enrolled in DREAMS and have started or completed at least one DREAMS service/intervention in the reporting period
        - _Primary Package completion as defined_: These are interventions/services that ALL AGYW in an age group should receive if they are enrolled in DREAMS.
        - For the FY22 the following services are counted under primary services 
            - **Age group 10-14**: HURU SRH and Educational subsistence
            - **Age group 15-19 & 20-24**: HTS, Condom, provision, Community-based HIV and Violence Prevention (Stepping Stone) and Financial Literacy including Savings Groups (WORTH+)
8. **QUESTION** : How many DREAMS beneficiaries have reached completion?
    - **Presentation** : Bar chart
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - Completed DREAMS: Requires that an individual AGYW has completed both the primary package for her age group, as well as all secondary interventions that as well as all secondary interventions that are appropriate based on her needs
9. **QUESTION** : BY SNU & age-group, what is the program completion rate?
    - **Presentation** : Speedmeter
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This graph shows the percentage of active DREAMS beneficiaries who have completed the DREAMS program in the selected year. The completion rate is calculated by dividing the number of girls who were active in the specified year and have completed DREAMS program in that same year by the total number of girls who are active in that same year.
10. **QUESTION** : How many DREAMS beneficiaries are receiving each DREAMS service?
    - **Presentation** : Horizontal Bar Chart
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This graph shows uptake of individual DREAMS services from the start of the selected reporting year (October) up to the latest data update (synchronization) in that reporting year/period. 
11. **QUESTION** : What are the trends in the number of beneficiaries reported in the different numerator disaggregates over time?
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - This indicator monitors the trend of DREAMS package completion as measured through the number of active girls in the 4 AGYW_PREV disaggregates at each quarter.
12. **QUESTION** : How does layering change with longer time in DREAMS?/ Are there specific age bands where layering is stronger or weaker?/ Are there specific SNUs where layering is stronger or weaker? What lessons can be learned and leveraged? 
    - **Presentation** : Stacked bar
    - **How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s)**:
        - The visual show counts of the number of services accessed by individual girls from the time they were enrolled into the DREAMS program up to their most recent encounter.
