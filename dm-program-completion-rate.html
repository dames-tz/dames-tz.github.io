    <h5>How to interpret the graph and indicator definition(s):</h5>
    <p>
        This graph shows the percentage of active DREAMS beneficiaries who have completed
        the DREAMS program in the selected year. The completion rate is calculated by dividing
        the number of girls who were active in the specified year and have completed DREAMS
        program in that same year by the total number of girls who are active in that same year.
